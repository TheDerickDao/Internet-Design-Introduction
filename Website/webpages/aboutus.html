				<div>
					<p class = "aubodytext1">
					Titans Basketball is a basketball club that originated only recently in 2014.
					Titans Basketball brings all types of basketball players together into a community where all players can enjoy the game
					no matter if you are young or old. The community provides a fun and exciting atmosphere and a competitive nature amongst players
					within the club and all other affiliating clubs who play against us on a weekly basis. We provide a learning experience and a competitive
					atmosphere in all age groups starting from Under 10s division to an Open Competition where players of any age can play.
					</p>
					
					<p class = "aubodytext2">
					On average per season, our club has a minimum of at least 1 to 2 teams per division which shows a widespread of players in all age ranges.
					At the start of the season, we tend to do a try-out for newer players to slot them in a team that they feel comfortable with, so our league provides
					all teams with a three-week-long pre-season which we use to evaluate whether the players are comfortable with the team that they play in. We ask
					them for their own opinions and feelings on how they will work well with their team and which team they prefer to be slotted in.
					</p>
					
					<p class = "aubodytext3">
					In the past season, Titans Basketball has come up to be champions in the Under 18s division and the Open competition. We, as a club
					established ourselves in the local league and also moved from having games on Saturdays for junior competition to Wednesday nights for the mens and mixed competition.
					We are in planning for establishing our club in the Monday Night Basketball Social Sport Competition at Curtin University for Mens and Mixed basketball.
					As a club, we wish to spread our club's image to a wider community to expand our club's potential and improve players who are willing to improve and provide
					players with a fun and competitive atmosphere to experience.
