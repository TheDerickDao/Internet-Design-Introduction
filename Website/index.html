						<p class = "bodytext1">Last Saturday held the Titans Basketball Training Camp that consisted of 63 
						young players, 22 on-court and behind the scenes staff and one proud club. The sixty-three young players 
						followed their 12 on-court coaches in drills and practice sessions for a 7 hour time period. The whole group was split into 
						smaller groups of 8 to 9 players where their coaches conduct training sessions and drills to improve their basketball skills.
						After a 2 hour practice and skills session, each group was considered a team and ran through scrimmages and practice matches.
						</p>
						
						<p class = "bodytext2">Practice matches started at noon where each team would play in a 40 minute scrimmage and are allowed 20 minutes of rest preceeding.
						Since having three courts was troublesome, teams would alternate to play on court and have resting breaks simultaneously. The tournament ran until all 
						teams have played each other in a round robin format and awards for Most Valuable Player, Best Team Player, Coach's Award and Coach of the Day awards were
						up for grabs. The tournament ladder was quite formidable with all players giving their best efforts and winning a grand prize of $500, which gave a huge
						incentive for all players to try to win the prize money. Team "I'm Coming For You" lead the groups with an outstanding 6-0 sweep, followed by Team "Splash City"
						with a commanding 5-1 win-lose ratio and only losing to the top team. The ladder is as follows:
						</p>
						
						<p class ="ladder1">
						(1) I'm Coming For You [6-0]
						</p>
						
						<p class ="ladder2">
						(2) Splash City [5-1]
						</p>
						
						<p class ="ladder3">
						(3) Underdoggys [4-2]
						</p>
						
						<p class ="ladder4">
						(4) Big Talk [3-3]
						</p>
						
						<p class ="ladder5">
						(5) PacOverManny [2-4]
						</p>
						
						<p class ="ladder6">
						(6) MannyOverPac [1-5]
						</p>
						
						<p class ="ladder7">
						(7) DeezNuts [0-7]
						</p>
						
						<p class = "bodytext3">
						With the ending of the exciting and hard working camp, as the Titans Basketball Club, we would like to congratulate Team "I'm Coming For You"
						for winning the $500 cash prize. The Most Valuable Player award was awarded to Stephen Curry who averaged 32.1 points per game with 8.2 assists
						and 5.6 rebounds, there was nothing more exciting to watch than to see this young player play his heart out on the court. Alongside the MVP award was
						the Best Team Player award which was also given to Stephen Curry who made the whole camp enjoyable with the brightest personality and cheer for all
						the players to enjoy the camp with. The Coach's Award was awarded to Kawhi Leonard who showed outstanding defensive motives on the court averaging around
						8 blocks per game, 10 rebounds and 12 points per game which gave a huge boost to his team's defensive pressure. Finally, the Coach of the Day award was given
						to Steve Kerr who coached the "I'm Coming For You" team to a flawless 6-0 victory within the tournament and winning the $500 cash prize money. He gave lots of
						momentum to the team's mindset and actions and always prompting them to put in more effort. His team's defensive pressure was what made that team go on a long
						stretch and it was all drawn up by Coach Kerr who thoughtfully assessed the gameplay over the quarters of the game and changed up defensive formations from time to time.
						</p>
						
						<p class = "bodytext4">
						Titans Basketball, as an organisation, would like to thank all the players, supporters, coaches and staff for making this camp successful and congratulations to all
						teams and players who ended up winning various prizes and awards. Hope to see familiar faces next time in our camp that is going to be planned out to initialise in September
						and hopefully it will be as good of a turn out as this one.
